🚀 EmbedID - Code Ownership Protection

📌 Overview

EmbedID is a lightweight cryptographic tool designed to embed ownership signatures into source code, ensuring developers can verify authenticity and protect intellectual property. Using a combination of comment-based encoding, invisible markers, and encryption-based ciphers, EmbedID secures source files without impacting functionality.
🔥 Key Features

    ✅ Signature Embedding:

        Cryptographically inserts ownership markers within source code for verification.

        Ensures persistent identifiers that remain intact across modifications.

    ✅ Verification System:

        Confirms whether a signature exists in a given file.

        Detects unauthorized alterations to the embedded identifier.

    ✅ Multiple Cipher Methods:

        Comment-Based Marking → Human-readable ownership tags.

        Invisible Character Encoding → Zero-width spaces for hidden identifiers.

        Vigenère Cipher → Basic encryption for added security.

        AES Encryption (Coming Soon) → High-strength cryptographic security.

    ✅ Watermarking System:

        Adds a branding watermark for reinforced ownership tracking.

        Helps identify authorship even across multiple versions.

    ✅ Automated Testing Suite:

        Uses pytest for unit tests, edge cases, and performance validation.

    ✅ Flask Web Interface:

        Provides a simple UI for embedding and verifying ownership.

        Supports batch file processing for bulk verification.

🏗️ Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

    Python 3.10+ (Recommended)

    Flask (For the web interface)

    Pytest (For automated testing)

🔹 Install Dependencies

Run inside the project directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Run the Web Interface

Launch Flask with:

python app.py

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

🔹 Running Automated Tests

Ensure all functionality is validated before deployment:

pytest tests/

🛠️ Usage Guide

Embedding a Signature (Flask Interface)

    Open the EmbedID Web Interface (http://127.0.0.1:5000).

    Enter the signature text in the embed form.

    Upload your source code file.

    Click Embed, and the system will cryptographically insert the identifier.

Verifying a Signature

    Open the EmbedID Web Interface (http://127.0.0.1:5000).

    Enter the signature text to verify.

    Upload the source code file.

    Click Verify, and EmbedID will check whether the identifier exists.

Embedding via Python Functions

Use EmbedID programmatically:

from ciphers_manager import embed

file_content = "def hello(): print('Hello, world!')"
embedded_content = embed("comment", "OwnerSignature", file_content)
print(embedded_content)  # View modified source code with embedded identifier
